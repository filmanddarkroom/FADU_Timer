# Film and Darkroom User F-Stop Enlarger Timer

An Android based darkroom enlarger timer using f-stop timing techniques.


The app is built using the MIT App Inventor 2 development environment [AI2](https://appinventor.mit.edu)

The electronically literate can add hardware to switch the lamp on and off via the phone's WiFi.  See the manual for details.  

Even without WiFi switching hardware, the timer has been made useful when manually switching the enlarger's lamp by adding a count-in delay and providing a continuous test-strip mode with audio warnings before each subsequent strip exposure.

## Getting Started

There are two branches:

	1) master : holds the currently released version of the app as available on the google play store.
	
	2) wip : holds the current work-in-progress development version.  This version may not be stable.

### Prerequisites

To edit the app you will need an App Inventor 2 login and import the AIA project file into your My Projects area.
