# Film and Darkroom User F-Stop Enlarger Timer

An Android based darkroom enlarger timer using f-stop timing techniques.


The app is built using the MIT App Inventor 2 development environment [AI2](https://appinventor.mit.edu)

The electronically literate can add hardware to switch the lamp on and off via the phone's WiFi.  See the manual for details.  

Even without WiFi switching hardware, the timer has been made useful when manually switching the enlarger's lamp by adding a count-in delay and providing a continuous test-strip mode with audio warnings before each subsequent strip exposure.



## Latest

24-Mar-2019: wip branch version 1.3.4.  On the STRIPS tab I have added a "SINGLE" mode.  This mode may be used when you want to take your test strips from the same area of the negative each time -  tis is useful when you have a very important area or if the rest of the negative does not have the full range of tones necessary to get good test strips.  Similar to the MANUAL mode, but each strip exposure is the full f-stop incemental exposure for that strip and not an incemental one based on the previous strip.  This also now makes the MAIN tab's F-stop Mode section completely obsolete so that needs to go.  All I need to do now is to decide what to do with all that new space :-).



## Getting Started

There are two branches:

	1) master : holds the currently released version of the app as available on the google play store.
	
	2) wip : holds the current work-in-progress development version.  This version may not be stable.

### Prerequisites

To edit the app you will need an App Inventor 2 login and import the AIA project file into your My Projects area.
